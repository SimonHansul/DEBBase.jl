# example for a data config file
# data is divided into time-resolved and scalar
# the minimum information required for each entry is a name and path
# the basic structure is 
# time_resolved:
#   - name: 
#     path
#   ...
# scalar:
#   - name: 
#   - path:
# ...
# paths are given relative to the project directory root
